 abstract = {With the introduction of automated driving without driver supervision, the automotive industry breaks new ground not just in functionality, but also in terms of validation. Even the most extensive road tests cannot statistically prove the safety of an automated vehicle. This makes the use of alternative validation techniques necessary. In principle, these techniques are already known but in order to apply them many fundamentals must still be determined, especially the base amount of required field data. Thus, methods for obtaining this data from road testing and field applications gain a high importance for future safety certification as a basis for the approval of vehicle automation systems.},
